## QuoteCollector
QuoteCollector allows the user to submit and search quotes.

Quotes contain an optional Header, the origial Author, 
one or more optional tags and additional info like the
movie/series the quote is from.

Quotes can be submitted via the frontend, but the tags are
created at the backend. Every user has his own, unique quotes,
he can not see quotes of other users. 

Quotes are searchable in the frontend via author, content, 
tags or the additional info.

Users have to be entered via the backend at the moment because
i am testing the whole thing atm.
